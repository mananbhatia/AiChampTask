Shubham Agrawal
Pursuing MS in Micro- and Nanoelectronics | Student Assistant
(HiWi) at RWTH Aachen University
Aachen-Mitte
Summary
I have always been fascinated by electronic gadgets, and how they
make our work so easy. I love the way technology has changed
this world. How a small thing such as a transistor can do wonders.
I study something new every day and it surprises me every single
time.
During my bachelor's, I studied electronics and communications.
Subjects like Analog and digital system designs, Electronic Devices
and Circuits, and VLSI design interested me the most. It was when I
worked on the project ""Voice-controlled Robocar"" during my Summer
Training in Embedded systems at TATA CMC  when I really felt
connected to the subject and its applications. During my Internship
at DRDO, New Delhi, I came across compound semiconductors
devices such as HEMTs and their fabrication. This was the time I
decided to take my career forward and pursue MS in Micro- and
Nanoelectronics to study more about the subject.
In my last year in Germany, I have learned about the developments,
applications, and challenges in the fabrication of nanoelectronic
devices. Solid State Devices, Compound Semiconductor, and
Optical Communications were the major subjects of interest. My
fondness towards these subjects earned me a good grade and a
Deutschlandstipendium scholarship from Bildungsfonds der RWTH.
Currently, I am working with the Chair of Integrated Digital Systems
and Circuit Design on FPGAs. 
I believe in hard work and maximum efforts. I am looking forward
to building my career in Fabrication of semiconductor devices and
Analog & Digital Design.
